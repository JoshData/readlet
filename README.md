Readlet
=======

By [Joshua Tauberer](http://razor.occams.info).

This is a bookmarklet that creates a [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) speed-reading "reticule" for any web page you are viewing.

Visit this project at [https://occams.info/readlet/](https://occams.info/readlet/). Drag and drop the bookmarklet link into your bookmarks toolbar. Then go visit your favorite newspaper or blog and when you have an article up, click Readlet in your bookmark toolbar to start it.

You will need to create a Spritz account to use this.
